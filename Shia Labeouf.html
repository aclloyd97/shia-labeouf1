You’ve never met him before, but childhood memories of some live-action Disney TV program inexplicably run across your mind. It’s really him, you realize, I’m actually being chased by Shia LaBeouf. In this moment of adrenaline-addled confusion, you also notice something that causes pins and needles to run down your arms. Shia LaBeouf, his face--no, his mouth--in particular, is drenched in blood.

You quicken your pace into an urgent dash. You have no doubts now that you are [[running for your very life|Run]].

Little do you know that Shia Labeouf anticipated this move from you, and he is awaiting your arrival. In a match of sprinting, you and him are running head to head- him towards you. You, towards safety. In the end, you stumble over the thick brush on the ground, and fall to the ground. Looks like the path of least resistance ended up being a path towards [[death|Death]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="hide1" tags="death" position="2504,1807">You find a hollow log and bury yourself inside as much as you can. The dew turned the dirt into soft mud, and your fingernails are covered with filth as you claw your way to safety. You wait and wait until you start shivering from the cold and trembling with fear. You hear footsteps coming towards you, and you look up to see Shia Labeouf with wide, hungry eyes. [[You become a feast.|Death]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="bear trap run" tags="" position="2254,1950">You begin sprinting to this safe haven. It’s really the only option you have right now, and you&#x27;re bound to outrun Shia. As you step through the brush, you get a searing pain through your leg. You tumble to the floor and reach for your leg, trembling in pain. A bear trap has been wrapped around the shin of your leg. You’re immediately immobilized, panicking over what to do next.

You begin to creep your way through the forest, moving as slowly as possible to make as little noise as you can. Your breath is shaking as you trudge your way through the brush. The dew is dripping into your socks as you push past the tall foliage of the forest. You’re almost halfway there when you hear a loud SNAP- you suddenly feel intense pain surging through your leg. You look down, while still standing in shock, to see a bear trap wrapped around your leg. You look up and see the cottage in the distance, so close, yet out of reach. 

The truth is, you’re stuck. You have no way to move forward towards that cottage, the only safe haven that you see. You begin to panic as you hear rustling from afar. Your blood begins to boil, your stomach cramps with adrenaline, and your head begins to pound as your heart races and pounds blood throughout your body. You hear him coming. What do you do next?

It couldn’t be. You look at it again, slowly this time, and see that it’s just you, looking savage as ever. You get the feeling that you’re being watched, so you look around but see that you are alone. You look towards the cabin and know that you must get there if you hope to have any chance of surviving. Then, you look back at your leg. It’s bleeding profusely and you’re feeling flushed. You must hurry and decide what to do! Are you going to….

You step back from the doorway as you hear footsteps getting louder. Suddenly, the door swings open and you’re blinded the light coming from within the cabin. You see a tall dark silhouette of a man standing before you. You feel relief, and drop to your knees, thanking the shrouded figure for opening the door, and beg him to let you in. He stands there for a moment and says nothing. Then, he steps forward into the darkness of the night, and you’re now able to gaze upon your savior. You shrink, paralyzed from what you see...Shia!
